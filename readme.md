# <u>Setup and Maintenance for the DE10-Nano</u>


## Quick Guide

#### Build Image
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/kevmck451/FPGA_LineArray_FOSSN.git
cd FPGA_LineArray_FOSSN
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.de10-nano -L
```

#### SD Card Image

- mount point of the SD card, but the device name
```zsh
lsblk 
```
- the name that corresponds with the mount point / SD card name
- mine is 'sdb'
- unmount the SD card (if it's mounted)
- it wont hurt to do this if you're not sure
```zsh
sudo umount /dev/sdb
```
- decompress and Write Image

```zsh
zstdcat result/sd-image/*.img.zst | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```
- if you eject the sd card when it's done and reinsert it, it should say NixOS as the sd card name


#### 3.1: Starting up the DE10
- put the SD card in the DE10
- set de10 mel switches to all 0 (up)
- plug the power cable to the DE10


#### 3.4: SSH Connection with MacBook
- SSH into FPGA from MacBook with jumping
```zsh
ssh nixos@192.168.80.2 -J kevmck@141.225.162.254    
```

## <u>3. Rebuilding Software Changes</u>
```zsh
cd Desktop/FPGA_LineArray_FOSSN
git pull
nix develop --profile profiles/dev
nixos-rebuild --target-host nixos@192.168.80.2 --fast --use-remote-sudo --flake .#de10-nano switch -L 
```


#### Using the Device
```zsh
ssh nixos@192.168.80.2
record
```
- if you want to be able to exit out of terminal, start tmux session before record

## <u>First Time Setup Instructions</u>
- Building the necessary files for operating the DE10 Nano must be done with:
  - a pc with an intel processor running linux
  - Ubuntu is recommended, but other variants like lubuntu can work
  - lubuntu is lite ubuntu which is for computers with limited cpu ability
- This process was tested on a [Wo-We Mini PC](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLD8JRWK?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
  - it worked but was very slow and needed special consideration with some aspects of the nix builds 
  - It's processor is an Intel Celeron N4020 CPU @ 1.1GHz x 2 (4GB RAM) running [lubuntu 24.04 64 bit](https://lubuntu.me/downloads/)
- It was also test with a [GMKtec Mini PC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B75PT2RY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1)
  - processor is an Intel 11th Gen N5105 @ 3.4GHz x 4 (8GB RAM) running [Ubuntu 20.04.6](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)


---
## <u>1. Programming Environment Setup</u>

### 1.1: Computer Requirements
- recommended minimum computer requirements
  - having two cores and 4GB memory with swap memory at 16GB is theoretically possible
  - four cores with 8GB memory and 16GB swap memory took 10+hrs to build for the first time

---
### 1.2: Installing Necessary Libraries
- htop: used to monitor computer during builds
```zsh
sudo apt install htop
```
- git: updating code repository after changes
```zsh
sudo apt install git
```
- wormhole: easily transfer files over the network without needing an IP
```zsh
sudo apt install magic-wormhole
```
- curl: used to install nix / copies files from a url
```zsh
sudo apt install curl
```
- nix: environment shells / NixOS builds / etc
```zsh
sudo apt install nixos
```
- ifconfig: used to see device's network information (specifically IP address)
```zsh
sudo apt install net-tools
```
- ssh: allows you to "login" to other computers and control them from the terminal
```zsh
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
- zstd: for decompressing .zst files
```zsh
sudo apt install zstd
```
- minicom: used to communicate with devices through UART
```zsh
sudo apt install minicom
```
- Sometimes, you might need appropriate permissions to access these devices
- You can change the permissions by adding your user to the dialout group
- kevmck would be replaced with your username
```zsh
sudo usermod -aG dialout kevmck
```
- program that tries to find modems on serials ports so get rid of it
```zsh
sudo apt purge modemmanager
```
This process is actually a perfect segway into NixOS in that in order to set up Ubuntu OS to do what you need.
This process has to be done every time a new computer is set up. That can be kind of cumbersome.
What if there was an OS that you could declare everything you need up front and then build/rebuild when changes are made.
Although Nix has many features, this is main advantage of using nix that you can declare everything you need
and you know that it will be built the same way everytime and will always work exactly the way it's suppose to

---
### 1.3: Installing Nix 
- [Nix Website](https://nixos.org/download/#nixos-iso)
- Browsing for Nix Packages [Package Search Website](https://search.nixos.org/packages?ref=itsfoss.com) 
- Multi-user installation for Linux
```zsh
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```
- Adding the flake feature
- the folder might already exist
```zsh
sudo mkdir /etc/nixos
sudo nano /etc/nixos/nixos.conf
```
- Add this to the config file
- the first line is most important
- if there's something already there, delete it
~~~
# Nix Config File

# enable flake feature
experimental-features = nix-command flakes

# specifies which users are trusted by the Nix daemon
trusted-users = @root

# automatically optimize the store by deduplicating files
# performing other optimizations to reduce disk usage and improve performance
auto-optimise-store = true
~~~

---
### 1.4: Increasing Swap Memory
What is Swap Memory and why it's important
- check current swap memory size with htop or this;
```zsh
sudo swapon --show
```
- disable current swap file temporarily
```zsh
sudo swapoff /swapfile
```
- resize the swap file to 16GB
```zsh
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=16384
```
- set the correct permissions
```zsh
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
```
- setup the swap area
```zsh
sudo mkswap /swapfile
```
- enable the swap file
```zsh
sudo swapon /swapfile
```
- you should see the swap changing in htop but can also check with this:
```zsh
sudo swapon --show
```
- Edit the '/etc/fstab' file to ensure the swap file is used at boot
```zsh
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
- add or update the following line to ensure it reads:
~~~
/swapfile none swap sw 0 0
~~~

## <u>2. Building SD Card Image</u>

### 2.1: Build SD Card Image for DE10
- This repo contains an already made NixOS system for the DE10
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/kevmck451/FPGA_LineArray.git
```
```zsh
cd FPGA_LineArray
```
- this only needs to be done once
- then updates can be run from the device itself with ```nix rebuild``` command

- run the command:
```zsh
nix build .#nixosConfigurations.de10-nano -L
```
- add the -j1 flag if using small cpu computers (1 job built at a time)
- -L is to see a verbose output as it builds
- this will take some time the first time (8+ hours potentially)
- there is no harm in stopping the build and restarting it
- it could potentially reduce memory if needed
- might run into 'lack of disk space' error
  - this might be due to tmp space not big enough
  - google remount /tmp with larger size
---

### 2.2: Create Bootable Drive
- this part could be done on any computer
- the ```nix build``` command from above makes a folder called "result"
- inside that folder is sd-image folder
- inside that is a .img.zst file
- use zstdcat & dd to decompress the image and write it to the SD card

1. Insert SD card into computer
2. Identify sd card's device name
   - not the mount point of the SD card, but the device name
```zsh
lsblk 
```
   - the name that corresponds with the mount point / SD card name
   - mine is 'sdb'

3. Unmount the SD card (if it's mounted)
   - it wont hurt to do this if you're not sure
```zsh
sudo umount /dev/sdb
```
4. Decompress and Write Image
   - *Warning:* incorrect use of ```dd``` commands could destroy your computer's internal disk, so use with care

```zsh
zstdcat result/sd-image/*.img.zst | sudo dd of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
```
- if you eject the sd card when it's done and reinsert it, it should say NixOS as the sd card name

---
## <u>3. First Connection to DE10-Nano</u>

### 3.1: Starting up the DE10
- put the SD card in the DE10
- set de10 mel switches to all 0 (up)
- connect to the de10 through the UART mini usb connector
- plug the power cable to the DE10

There are two ways we will connect to the DE10:
1. connection over UART 
2. connection via ssh with ethernet over usb 
    
---

#### 3.2: UART Connection on Linux
- plug in the mini-usb cable into the UART connector (by the ethernet port)
- the LEDs should light up immediately because it's getting power over the usb cable
  - even if the board is off
- start the UART connection
- most likely USB0, but maybe USB1
```zsh
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200
```
- once run, you should see start up of device
- to exit session: press control a, let go of both, press x

---

#### 3.3: SSH Connection
- plug in the micro-usb cable into the board
- connection to the internet is required
- SSH into FPGA
```zsh
ssh nixos@192.168.80.2
```
- save the address to your computer (optional)
```zsh
sudo nano /etc/hosts 
```
- add to the file
~~~
# DE10 Nano FPGA
192.168.80.1 fpga
~~~
- now you can ssh into it with this command
```zsh
ssh nixos@fpga 
```

#### 3.4: SSH Connection with MacBook
- this is done on the MacBook terminal
- get intel linux ip address and username
- Copy SSH key to connect without password
- replace kevmck with your username
- replace that IP address with your linux computer's
```zsh
ssh-copy-id kevmck@141.225.162.254
```
- SSH into intel linx comp
```zsh
ssh kevmck@141.225.162.254
```
- SSH into FPGA from MacBook with jumping
```zsh
ssh nixos@192.168.80.2 -J kevmck@141.225.162.254    
```

---
### 3.5 Test FPGA wavdump functionality
- on macbook, ssh into fpga with jumping (from 5.3)
- run the wavdump command with -f for fake mics
- run with -r for raw output, not convolved
```zsh
sudo wavdump -f -r fake_mic_test.wav
```
- once a few samples have been generated, press ctl c to stop

- copy the file to macbook for inspection with Audacity
```zsh
scp -J kevmck@141.225.162.254 nixos@192.168.80.2:/home/nixos/fake_mic_test.wav .
```
```zsh
scp nixos@192.168.80.2:/home/nixos/0_0.wav .
```
```zsh
scp nixos@192.168.80.2:"/home/nixos/*.*" .
```
- from here, changes made to code will need to be rebuilt

---
# <u>Developing and Maintenance</u>
## <u>1. Updating OS Packages</u>

### 1.1: Adding Shell Libraries
- find packages in 'nixos/sd-image/default.nix'
- when changes are made, follow process in 3. Rebuilding Software Changes to implement


### 1.2: Adding Python Libraries



---
## <u>2. Library Update Maintenance</u>



---
## <u>3. Rebuilding Software Changes</u>

- if using MacBook to control headless Intel Linux PC then ssh into intel linux pc
```zsh
ssh kevmck@141.225.167.151
```
- from here you can either do this from the intel linux comp or ssh'd from macbook
- cd into FPGA folder with nix flake file
```zsh
cd Desktop/FPGA_LineArray
```
- update the changes that were made to the intel linux pc
```zsh
git pull
```
- cd into FPGA folder
- get inside a nix shell to rebuild any changes
```zsh
nix develop --profile profiles/dev
```
- note: if using a dash (nix-develop) nix would expect a default.nix file
  - not using the dash, signifies using a nix.flake file

```zsh
nixos-rebuild --target-host nixos@192.168.80.2 --fast --use-remote-sudo --flake .#de10-nano switch -L 
```

- command to check on scripts running in systemd
```zsh
journalctl -fu start-mic-recorder
```
- remove all wav files in current directory
```zsh
rm -f *.wav
```
